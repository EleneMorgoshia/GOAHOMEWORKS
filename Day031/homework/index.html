        <p>I am Elene Morgoshia, a student at Tbilisi State University. I am a very hardworking and responsible person.<br>When
            I have a goal, I do my best to achieve it. Having a clear plan for my goal is crucial to me. Of course, sometimes,
            everything does not go the way you planned, but it is simpler when I know every step of my journey, regardless of
            the new obstacles. I adapt and create a new plan. I am sociable and friendly, making it easy to communicate with
            me.I love challenges and self-examination. Obstacles encourage me to keep going, stay motivated, and grow
            personally</p>
