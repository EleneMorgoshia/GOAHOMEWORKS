# 'cap' is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
# 'on' is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.
# 'wait' is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the driver.
# If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.
